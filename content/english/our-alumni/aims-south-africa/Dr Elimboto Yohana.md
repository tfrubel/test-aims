Elimboto, from Tanzania, obtained his BEd Science from the University of Dar Es Salaam in 2008, he completed his Postgraduate Diploma in Mathematical Sciences at AIMS South Africa in 2009 and his Master’s in Computational and Applied Mathematics (with distinction) from Wits in 2012. In July 2019, he was awarded a PhD from the University of KwaZulu-Natal for his thesis titled: ‘Probing the Nature of Dark Energy with 21-cm Intensity Mapping.’ “I would like to extend my thanks to DAAD and AIMS South Africa for the financial support towards my PhD studies.” His research interests include: Cosmology (Dark energy and Dark matter, Large-scale structure of universe surveys), Scientific computing, Data science, Mathematical and Statistical Analyses. “I am very keen to promote and advance the status of education, science and technology in my country and the Africa continent in general. To achieve this, I founded the Tanzania Students and Scholars Foundation Limited (TSSFL). TSSFL is established on the notion that knowledge is not only power but the answer to all challenges, and must be applied to solve various societal problems. TSSFL serves as a platform to bring together people who are focused, disciplined, dedicated, and faithfully striving to achieve and utilise their full educational, science and technology potential to provide unprecedented solutions to various, social, economic, educational and developmental challenges.” To realise the objectives of TSSFL, Elimboto launched an online platform, Open Discussion Forums, in 2014.
