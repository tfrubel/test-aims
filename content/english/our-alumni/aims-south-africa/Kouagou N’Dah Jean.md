Before joining AIMS South Africa, Jean completed his Bachelor’s degree in mathematics at the University of Abomey-Calavi and pursued the first semester of a Master’s in Pure Mathematics at IMSP, Porto-Novo. He chose AIMS due to its English instruction, essential in scientific pursuits, and the comprehensive bursary covering expenses. AIMS facilitated his growth in computer skills and English proficiency while fostering connections with diverse peers. He engaged in the Industry Immersion Programme in 2019 and completed the African Master’s in Machine Intelligence at AIMS Ghana in 2020, where he learned advanced machine learning techniques from industry experts like Google and Facebook. Currently in his third year of a Neuro-Symbolic AI PhD, Jean also serves as a Research Assistant at Paderborn University. His journey, shaped by AIMS, showcases his dedication and the institution’s transformative impact.
