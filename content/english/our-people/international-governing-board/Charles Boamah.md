Charles O. Boamah, former Senior Vice President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), is a globally respected finance executive with over 40 years of progressively challenging leadership experience in and outside of Africa.

Before assuming his final role at the AfDB as Senior Vice President, Charles served as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as well as acting First Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. He led or championed several major change initiatives at the AfDB, including reorganizations, re-engineering of business processes for greater efficiency, business continuity planning and implementation, and the increased decentralization of the bank's operations. Charles actively participated in or led major resource mobilization efforts, including three general capital increases and seven replenishments of the African Development Fund, spanning the terms of three AfDB Presidents.

Prior to joining the AfDB, Charles worked for First Interstate Bancorp (which merged with Wells Fargo Bank in early 1996) in California for 12 years. He began his professional career with Coopers & Lybrand (now PricewaterhouseCoopers or PwC).

Charles currently serves on the boards of directors of Africa50, the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), and the Design & Technology Institute (DTI Ghana).
