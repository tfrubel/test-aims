Following the successful kick-off of the 2025 Africa Scientifique: Leadership, Knowledge, and Skills for Science Communication annual three-phase programme’s Introductory Workshop (Phase 1) in February, AIMS South Africa, in partnership with African Gong, continued its journey with Phase 2 of this transformative Afrocentric capacity-building initiative.

Phase 1 laid a strong foundation in which the participants explored the strategic, global, historical, and contemporary dimensions of science communication. Phase 2 built on that. It featured an intensive and interactive three-day workshop dedicated to capacity building for the Mastercard Foundation Scholars at AIMS South Africa under the aegis of the Mastercard Foundation Scholars Program at AIMS Phase II.

The workshop was held from 14 to 16 April 2025 at AIMS South Africa. It provided Mastercard Foundation Scholars with a deeper, hands-on and minds-on engagement in science communication and public engagement practices. It aimed to empower them to leverage these skills for leadership, career growth, and making an impact across academia, industry, and beyond, enhancing their employability.

Opening remarks were delivered on the first day of the workshop by Prof. Karin-Therese Howell, Academic Director; Ms. Basirat Agboola, Lead of the Scholars Programme Partner Network at Mastercard Foundation; Dr. Elizabeth Rasekoala, President of African Gong; and Dr. Rejoyce Gavhi-Molefe, Manager of AIMS South Africa House of Science. 

In her keynote address, Ms Agboola welcomed the participants and emphasised that the Mastercard Foundation Scholars Programme goes beyond academic excellence. She highlighted that the programme is grounded in integrity, self-awareness, and a profound sense of purpose, which are essential to building a shared identity among Mastercard Foundation Scholars.

“Together as partners, we’re really going beyond academic excellence. It’s about inclusion, it’s about belonging, it’s about transformative leadership and service.” – Ms Agboola
Ms Agboola further noted that Phase 2 of the Africa Scientifique training was positioned as a unique opportunity for Mastercard Foundation Scholars to develop their advocacy skills, accelerate their early careers, and build strong networks across academia, government, and industry. 

“We are really encouraging you to soak this all up and to take it as an excellent foundation to deepen your network,” she added
She reminded Mastercard Foundation Scholars that they were selected not only for their academic brilliance but also for their potential to lead, innovate, and give back. She encouraged participants to embrace the journey ahead, stay connected, support one another, and never lose sight of their purpose.
