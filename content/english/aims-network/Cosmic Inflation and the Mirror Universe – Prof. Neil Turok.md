title: "Cosmic Inflation and the Mirror Universe – Prof. Neil Turok"
description: |
  "Professor Neil Turok, the founder of the AIMS Network and current Higgs Chair of Theoretical Physics at the University of Edinburgh, in a feature by The Conversation, shares his latest insights on the fundamental questions shaping our understanding of the universe.
  “We live in a golden age for learning about the universe. Our most powerful telescopes have revealed that the cosmos is surprisingly simple on the largest visible scales. Likewise, our most powerful “microscope”, the Large Hadron Collider, has found no deviations from known physics on the tiniest scales. These findings were not what most theorists expected. "
