Abu’s journey began in a humble Sudanese village where he faced the challenge of walking over an hour to reach the nearest school. Despite these hardships, his passion for mathematics flourished, inspiring him to excel. Abu achieved first-class honours in Mathematics from the University of Khartoum’s Faculty of Education. In 2016, he joined AIMS in South Africa, completing his Master’s in Mathematical Sciences. His choice of AIMS was driven by its reputation as Africa’s mathematical sciences cornerstone, featuring exceptional lecturers from across the globe. Abu praised the support of the administrative staff and dedicated tutors, unique to AIMS. He found unparalleled learning experiences here, emphasising, “AIMS was different; the skills I gained here are unmatched.” Returning to Sudan, Abu became a lecturer at the University of Khartoum. His AIMS-acquired expertise swiftly led to a promotion as Senior Lecturer. Currently, he continues his impactful work at the university and has been awarded a PhD scholarship to Yangzhou University in China. Reflecting on his AIMS experience, Abu acknowledged the transformative power of the opportunities provided. He highlighted the invaluable coding and programming skills acquired, shaping his teaching methods in an African university. Abu remains committed to his students, inspired by the transformative career experience AIMS bestowed upon him.
