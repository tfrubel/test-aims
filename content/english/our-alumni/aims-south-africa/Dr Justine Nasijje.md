Justine, originally from Uganda, is now a lecturer at the School of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Witwatersrand, South Africa. Her research focus lies in SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being, with significant contributions made to understanding the drivers of Under-Five mortality rates in Africa. Justine adeptly tackles challenges faced by researchers when analysing complex datasets, employing advanced statistical and machine learning methods to derive meaningful insights in the realm of public health. Her academic journey traces back to Makerere University, Uganda, where she completed a Bachelor of Science in Education, majoring in Mathematics. Inspired by a lecturer’s recommendation, she pursued her Postgraduate Diploma in Mathematics at AIMS South Africa in 2011. Justine credits AIMS with igniting her passion and broadening her perspective on the myriad ways mathematicians can contribute to diverse fields. This experience propelled her towards an academic career in Biostatistics, recognising the pivotal role her mathematical skills play in addressing crucial public health issues in Africa and beyond. AIMS served as the cornerstone for her professional trajectory. Following her time at AIMS, she pursued and completed her Master’s and PhD at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. Justine not only presented her research findings at both local and international conferences but also published her work in esteemed peer-reviewed journals. Her journey exemplifies the transformative impact of AIMS, shaping her into a dedicated researcher and educator in the field of Biostatistics.
