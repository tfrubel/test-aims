The African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) has joined the Open Quantum Institute (OQI) as a new member. The membership agreement which was signed on 3rd December, 2024, marks an important step in AIMS’ work in Africa leading in the research, development and application of quantum technologies to address global challenges.

The OQI is a multilateral governance initiative that promotes global and inclusive access to quantum computing and the development of applications for the benefit of humanity. As a novel science diplomacy instrument, it brings together academia, diplomacy, private sector and philanthropy stakeholders. OQI is hosted by CERN during its pilot phase (2024-2026).

Over the past 15 years, AIMS has generated a stream of talented young African scientists – making impact in fields ranging from epidemiology and public health to computer science, finance, and astronomy. AIMS through Quantum Leap Africa (QLA), which is a non-profit organization owned by AIMS, specifically focuses on catalyzing top quality high impact research in data science, smart systems engineering and drive the future IT revolution through quantum information.

Commenting on the significance of AIMS becoming a member of OQI, Dr. Prince Osei, Lead Scientist & Director, Quantum Leap Africa (QLA) and Centre President, AIMS Ghana said “Africa stands on the brink of experiencing rapid socioeconomic development leveraging on the quantum revolution. AIMS by joining OQI is poised to lead the continent to harness the power of quantum technology to provide innovative solutions to Africa’s pressing challenges.”

AIMS’ membership at OQI will allow it to actively be part of the implementation of the OQI’s goals of developing quantum technologies with practical applications that can help transform various sectors such as healthcare, energy and transportation and enable sustainable development on a global scale.
