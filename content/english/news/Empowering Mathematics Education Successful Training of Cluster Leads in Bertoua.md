AIMS Cameroon continues its dedicated partnership with the Ministry of Secondary Education (MINESEC) in Cameroon to enhance Mathematics education in secondary schools. From May 15th to 17th, 2024, AIMS TTP (Teachers Training Programme) organized a comprehensive training program in Bertoua aimed at equipping Cluster Leads (CLs) with the skills necessary to improve the quality of Mathematics instruction through collaboration and digital tools.

Focus of the Training

The training, held at the conference hall of the Regional Delegation of Secondary Education in the East Region, focused on three key areas:

Coordinating and Facilitating Learning: CLs were trained to coordinate and facilitate professional development among their peers, fostering a supportive environment where teachers can help each other grow.
Digitalizing Mathematics Lessons: Teachers learned how to create digital versions of their lessons, making use of modern technology to enhance learning experiences.
Utilizing Pedagogic Videos: The training included practical sessions on how to effectively use pedagogic videos available on the MINESEC platform in classroom settings.
Training Methodology

Using the Lesson Study approach, 30 teachers from 24 schools in Bertoua, representing both public and private sectors and both sub-systems of education, prepared seven lessons in groups prior to the training. During the event, these lessons were digitalized with the help of the new skills acquired.

Participants downloaded pedagogic videos from the MINESEC platform, prepared and presented lessons as they would in a real classroom, with peers observing and participating as students. This hands-on approach allowed teachers to experience firsthand the benefits and challenges of integrating digital tools into their teaching practices.

Collaborative Learning Environment

The training was characterized by a high level of collaboration and knowledge sharing. Teachers were visibly excited and eager to present their digitalized lessons, reflecting the enthusiasm and commitment to improving their teaching methods.

Evaluation and Feedback

At the end of the workshop, participants expressed a deeper understanding of the cluster strategy and how it should function. They felt confident in their newly acquired skills to facilitate cluster activities, digitalize lessons, and use pedagogic videos in their classrooms. The trainees committed to continuing their professional development by discussing challenges and success stories within their cluster groups before expanding these discussions to include other colleagues.

Enthusiastic Reception

Many teachers revealed it was their first time using the platform’s pedagogic videos in a classroom setting, with only 2 out of 30 having prior experience. This new exposure generated significant excitement and enthusiasm among the participants.

In summary, the training in Bertoua was a resounding success, highlighting the power of collaboration and digitalization in transforming Mathematics education. Our NGO remains committed to supporting teachers and enhancing the quality of education through innovative training programs and partnerships with educational authorities like MINESEC.
